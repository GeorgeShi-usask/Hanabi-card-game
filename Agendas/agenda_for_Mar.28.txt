Agenda for Mar. 28 2019


Status 
	- The StartMenu, CreateMenu, JoinMenu are done and be tested
	- Most of the JsonOps class is done (waiting for the release of the server)
	- PlayField is partially done
	- Most people already did two pair programming sessions (need one more)

Info
	- Need to refactor the class to match with the decided code convention


Decision
	- Do we have to implement Aspect? Do we have enough time?


Problem
	- When will the server be released?
